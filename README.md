PLACEMENT PATTERN EVALUATION- AN OVERVIEW
The project entitled as “Placement pattern evaluation” is used to evaluate the pattern
for placement. Placement pattern evaluation is an effective way to evaluate the patterns for
various companies involved in the placement. The project also evaluates the different
questions involved in each pattern. The questions are evaluated for all the academic years
respectively. The pattern is finally sent as an email to the respective students involved in the
placement scenario. Based on the patterns generated the mock test will be conducted for the
students. The questions will be shuffled for every student. The report is finally generated
based on the test attended.
The project thus helps the students to effectively prepare for an interview. The
software also helps the students to reduce the time spend on searching the patterns and
questions for different companies during placement.
STUDY ON EXISTING SYSTEM:
In the existing system, the placement company names and the details of the student
will be available. The student gathers the patterns and the questions by referring to different
website. The time taken for analyzing the patterns requires more time. Once the pattern is
evaluated by the student the students starts referring to the related questions. The time
consumption for this process is comparatively more.
 DRAWBACKS
 Inability to understand
 Time Consuming
